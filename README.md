The goal of this project is to demonstrate how raw retail data can be transformed into actionable business intelligence insights through a modern multi-tool pipeline. The workflow includes:

Python for ETL, cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering

SQLite + SQL for modeling, data slicing, and analytical exports

Power BI for interactive dashboards and KPI reporting

This mirrors how real analytics teams build reliable, scalable reporting systems across industries like E-commerce, Retail, and CPG.
